# What Happened: Where did we go
It's simple, we all lost interest in personalities until recently, we tried working on it in April but no one was talking in the 
discord, so the project just faded into obscurity, the original plan was a FNF Level, a Lore Based level (still got
implemented) and a level in Philly (probably another FNF one let's be honest)

And until now in May personalities was just a dead game, but now we are working on the game and working on it as
hard as we can, (mostly), and lemme tell you what we have been working on has been kicking my a@#! It's got a bunch
of art and it changes the type of gameplay! Instead of platforming its just [std::string::replace]

# Demo
Yes indeed Personalities will have a demo, in fact it is a demo, as of May 26 any version before v1.0.0 is a demo version of Personalities

# New Team Member
New Team member! Say hello to Logan Animations as an Artist/Animator, so far as I write this there is no project for them to work on

# Basic Release Plan: demo 0.6.x to v1.0
wanna know a rough estimate for version release? sure!

demo 0.6.x - sometime may-June

demo 0.7.x - June

demo 0.8.x - July

demo 0.9.x - august

v1.0.x - September-October

there are specific but rough plans for these releases, but I'm gonna wait until I share all that.

# Medals
I won't get into detail for this but most of them right now are for beating levels
the medals will be unlocked based on certain things you done, like any normal one,
there aren't many right now because ideas are low so yeah, if the update releases
soon there probably wont be many medals
